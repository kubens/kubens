<p>I&#39;ve started my journey with web industry 10 years ago as a Graphic Designer. After 3 successful years I decided to incorporate my skills into frontend world. I know how to design, how to deliver and create the best user experience.</p>
<p>Throughout the years of working in different sectors and for a wide range of clients, including small private companies as well as large corporations, I have discovered and learned new technologies. This experience gave me a new fresh look into smooth functionality and how to bring the sites&#39; and apps&#39; design to life.</p>
<p>My past few years confirmed, that I am a real React and React Native enthusiast willing to cooperate with anyone involved in developing. Therefore, if you want me to take you to a new level of development, please feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:kontakt@kubens.pl">kontakt@kubens.pl</a> or just call <a href="tel:+48698126712">+48 698 126 712</a></p>
